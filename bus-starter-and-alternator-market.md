<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Starter and Alternator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alternator</li><li>Starter Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bus starter and alternator market is divided into two primary segments: alternators and starter motors. Alternators generate electricity to power the bus's electrical systems and recharge the battery while the engine runs. Starter motors, on the other hand, are responsible for initiating the engine's operation by converting electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy. Both components are crucial for the efficient functioning of buses, ensuring reliability and performance in transportation applications.</p></p>
