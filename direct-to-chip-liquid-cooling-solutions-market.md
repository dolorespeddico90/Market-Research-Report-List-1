<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct-To-Chip Liquid Cooling Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase</li><li>Dual-phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct-To-Chip Liquid Cooling Solutions encompass two main types: single-phase and dual-phase cooling. Single-phase cooling utilizes a liquid that remains in a constant state, efficiently transferring heat away from the chip to a heat exchanger. In contrast, dual-phase cooling leverages a liquid that changes state—typically boiling and condensing—capturing more heat energy and providing superior thermal management. Both types enhance the performance and reliability of high-density computing systems, catering to diverse thermal management needs in data centers and advanced computing applications.</p></p>
